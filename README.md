# Open Repository for API Specs
A library of API specs built from ground up, specifically for the use in AI.

# Credits
Each API spec directory has a source.json file which mentions the source, if known.


A lot of the specs are from [https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory). Shoutout to them for the awesome work!
